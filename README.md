# espresence-occupancy-nightlight-multi-sensor
## A hidden (in plain sight) mmWave presence sensor with a PIR for fast motion integrated into a commercially available Night Light! Complete with a BLE Tracker and BT Proxy (optional in config) ability.

You can see my previous work on a basic version of this with an ESP32-S2 chip / MCU

For this improved model I chose to use a full featured ESP32 that has a dual radio capable of simultaneous WiFi connectivity and both BLE and BT (classic) so it can function as an optional BLE Tracker and / or Bluetooth Proxy.
