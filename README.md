You can see my previous work on a basic version of this with an ESP32-S2 chip / MCU
  https://github.com/DuncanIdahoCT/espresence-mmwave-nightlight-sensor

For this improved model I chose to use a full featured ESP32 that has a dual radio capable of simultaneous WiFi connectivity and both BLE and BT (classic) so it can function as an optional BLE Tracker and / or Bluetooth Proxy.

I won't go through all the build notes and hisotry here since that is covered in detail in the above linked repo but I'll cover the details of the parts used and how I modified the Night Light which, sadly, seems to be currently out of stock everywhere, I have a few more on backorder so I can make some of these for others or whatever.
